## What can it do for you?

The concept of BuildingGen is to offer a quick and easy solution for generating a variety of distinct building designs with minimal effort. While itâ€™s not intended to produce AAA-quality or 'hero' buildings, it serves as a foundation that can be enhanced by adding decorative elements or other details to refine the basic structures.
